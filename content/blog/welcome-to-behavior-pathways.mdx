# Welcome to Behavior Pathways

Welcome to our new website! We're excited to share our communication-first approach to Applied Behavior Analysis with you.

## Why communication comes first

At Behavior Pathways, we believe that communication is the foundation for all learning and growth. When children can express their needs, wants, and thoughts, everything else becomes possible.

## Our approach

We focus on:

- **Real-life practice** - Skills are learned where they're used
- **Parent coaching** - You're the most important part of the team
- **Collaboration** - We work with schools and families together

## Getting started
