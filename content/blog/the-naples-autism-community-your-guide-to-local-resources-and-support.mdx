# The Naples Autism Community: Your Guide to Local Resources and Support

_When Maria moved to Naples with her family last year, she felt isolated and overwhelmed. Her 5-year-old son, Alex, had recently been diagnosed with autism, and she didn't know where to turn for support. She worried about finding the right services, connecting with other families, and helping Alex feel comfortable in their new community._

_Six months later, Maria can't imagine living anywhere else. Through the Naples autism community, she's found not just services for Alex, but a whole network of support, friendship, and understanding that has transformed her family's life._

This is the power of community—and Naples, Bonita Springs, and Collier County have built something truly special.
