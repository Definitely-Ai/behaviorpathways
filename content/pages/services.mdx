# Services

Our services are designed for daily life. We practice where skills are used, not only in a clinic.

## Communication skill building

We teach requesting, turn taking, expressive and receptive language, and conversational foundations. We support AAC and PECS so your child can be successful with the system that fits best.

## In home and community based sessions

We schedule around family routines, coach caregivers in the moment, and practice skills during meals, play, errands, and outings.

## School collaboration

We coordinate with your team and contribute to classroom strategies and IEP goals. We train teachers on prompts, supports, and data that are simple and practical.

## Behavior support

We use functional assessment to understand what behavior communicates. Then we teach gentle prevention strategies and new skills that work in daily life.
