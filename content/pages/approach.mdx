# Our Approach

We keep the process simple and transparent.

## Start with listening

Your first visit is a conversation. We listen to your story and your hopes.

## Clear plan

You receive a short plan in plain language with three to five goals you can see and measure.

## Coaching first

We model strategies, then practice with you, then support you as you lead.

## Real life practice

Sessions happen where communication happens. Home, school, community.

## Review and celebrate

We check progress together, adjust, and celebrate every step forward.
