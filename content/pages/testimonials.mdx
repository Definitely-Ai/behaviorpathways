Real stories from families who chose a communication first path.

## G.J.

When my daughter first started working with Valentina she barely interacted with anyone, she only wanted to use the tablet all day, and she did not ask for anything at all. After several months, she was able to use short sentences to ask for things she wanted, she played with different toys, and she interacted more with me and her mom. She even asked me to read her a book and sing her songs.

## M.L.

My daughter spent years going to a clinic and they let her go without her making much progress. Valentina was able to teach my daughter how to communicate quickly. She was very helpful with teaching my husband and I how to communicate better with her and how to handle her behaviors. She also taught my daughter's school the same strategies. My daughter was able to use her voice more than ever and she used her PECS book all by herself.

## K.M.

My son had a lot of tantrums when he first started ABA therapy. Valentina was amazing with him. She was so patient and made sure to teach him in a fun way. They had an amazing bond and he even started to use his words with her.
