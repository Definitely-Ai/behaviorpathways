      'When my daughter first started working with Valentina she barely interacted with anyone, she only wanted to use the tablet all day, and she didnâ€™t ask for anything at all. After several months, she was able to use short sentences to ask for things she wanted, she played with different toys, and she interacted more with me and her mom. She even asked me to read her a book and sing her songs.',
